# E-commerce Microservices Application in Go

Welcome to the E-commerce Microservices Application, a project built using Golang, protocol buffers, and gRPC. This application showcases a microservices architecture, demonstrating the power and flexibility of the Go programming language for building scalable and efficient e-commerce systems.

## Key Features:

- **Microservices Architecture:** The application is structured into microservices, each responsible for specific functionalities such as handling demands, managing inventory, and providing listings.

- **gRPC Communication:** Leveraging gRPC for communication between microservices ensures efficient and language-agnostic communication, enhancing the modularity of the system.

- **Protocol Buffers:** The use of protocol buffers provides a language-agnostic data serialization format, optimizing data exchange between microservices.
